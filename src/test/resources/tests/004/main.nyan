# Defined in the game engine:

Mod():
    name : text
    patches : set(Patch)

Building():
    name : text

Resource():
    name : text
    icon : file

DropSite():
    accepted_resources : set(Resource)


# Above are engine features.
# Lets create content in your official game data pack now:

Gold(Resource):
    name = "Bling bling"
    icon = "gold.svg"

Food(Resource):
    name = "Nom nom"
    icon = "food.svg"

TownCenter(Building, DropSite):
    name = "Town Center"
    accepted_resources = {Gold, Food}


# Now let's have a user mod that adds a new resource:

Silicon(Resource):
    name = "Silicon"

TCSilicon<TownCenter>():
    accepted_resources += {Silicon}

SiliconMod(Mod):
    name = "The modern age has started: Behold the microchips!"
    patches = {TCSilicon}
